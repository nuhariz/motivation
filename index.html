<blockquote cite="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042810001503"> This study aims at determining the factors that increase the motivation of students in an online course conducted by a researcher. In this framework, the students were asked to explain their opinions about the factors increasing their motivation and what can be done to increase their motivation. The research results show that learning-teaching process, competencies of instructors, participants’ attention, online learning environment/technical infrastructure and time management affect motivation in the online courses. It is also stated that online learning environment/technical infrastructure, learning-teaching process and measurements and evaluation should increase their motivation. </blockquote>

<p style="color: brown"> Adult students become more motivated to learn whether online or in person when <mark> they are treated like unique individuals with goals, interests, and lives of their own.</mark> Once they realize that you are on their side in the role of coach, say, rather than tyrant or micromanager they will feel more comfortable contributing to class discussions and relating the subject matter to their own lives. The ultimate goal is to strengthen adult students’ intrinsic levels of motivation while minimizing focus on extrinsic sources of motivation, so as to help ensure that they are not dependent upon you for their learning. </p>

 <p> Because online learners are often non-traditional, adult students who have been active in the workforce for at least several years, <b> it could be helpful to apply a few commonly-known leadership and management strategies </b> to your online teaching approach: Resist the urge to dominate, and opt for motivating instead; practice your listening skills; hold students accountable; be human; view dips in student performance as teaching or learning opportunities; and communicate to students that they matter. </p>

 <p>One of the most effective ways to help motivate students online <mark> involves connecting the "real world", so to speak, to the subject matter at hand.</mark> This could mean something as simple as beginning each day with an online class discussion relating something relevant in the news to the current lesson at hand. Alternately, you might choose to engage in role playing by having students apply current reading concepts to future careers or hypothetical situations. Dialogic interaction  has been shown to be a valuable part of the learning process, as the act of engaging in dialectic with others reinforces concepts by helping students to solidify and elaborate upon key concepts from the subject matter or reading material. Either of these applications could be carried out in online chat rooms via student discussion, thus ensuring engagement with both the subject material and each other. </p>

<p> Another way to help students feel more motivated is <mark>by having them track their own progress and learning processes.</mark>  One technique is the portfolio method, in which students compile all their work into a single folder or binder so as to allow them to track their own progression from the first paper or assignment to the last. A physical compilation would be especially helpful for online learners, as it’s too easy to feel as if all evidence of learning and subject matter comprehension is being relegated to the digital realm. In addition, ask students to reflect upon the learning process, after completing each assignment. That way, they are more likely to feel in control of their own education, and they’ll become more aware of their own strengths and weaknesses, so as to feel better able to understand where they need more guidance.</p>
